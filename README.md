# Dapper Dasher

**Dapper Dasher** is a 2D platformer featuring animated characters, dynamic backgrounds, and simple jump controls, built using C++ and the raylib library.

## Description

The player controls a running character that jumps over obstacles — animations play smoothly only when the character is on the ground. Multiple scrolling background layers create a sense of depth. The game includes basic physics for gravity and jumping, as well as collision detection with enemies (nebulae).

## Features

- Animated character with 6 running frames.  
- Multiple parallax scrolling backgrounds (background, midground, foreground).  
- Basic gravity and jump physics.  
- Collision detection with enemies.  
- Smooth animation frame updates independent of FPS.
